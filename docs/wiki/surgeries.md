Some injuries and medical conditions require surgical intervention to repair the damage and restore the patient to full health. More Injuries introduces a variety of new surgeries that can be performed by skilled doctors to treat complex injuries and medical conditions.  
Just like base game surgeries, these new surgeries will be available in the *operations* tab of the selected pawn.

## Decompressive Craniectomy

$\rightarrow$ *see [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke)*

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Cure stroke: decompressive craniectomy** &mdash; Perform a decompressive craniectomy to cure a hemorrhagic stroke.  
> Decompressive craniectomy is a neurosurgical procedure in which part of the skull is removed to allow a swelling or herniating brain room to expand without being squeezed. It is performed on victims of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and other conditions associated with raised intracranial pressure. Use of this surgery is controversial and associated with a higher risk of complications, but it can be life-saving in cases of severe brain swelling.  
> A challenging surgery that requires familiarity with neurosurgical techniques and a steady hand. Yields a moderate success rate."_

**Used for**: Treating [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke) with good medical knowledge and industrial equipment at a moderate success rate.

The bone will be set in place, realigned, and reinforced with metal plates and screws to prevent micromovements and promote proper healing, allowing the patient to regain full use of the affected limb much faster than with other methods.  
> Although being more invasive than other methods, surgery allows for a more precise and stable repair of the fracture, ensuring a faster and more complete recovery."_

**Used for**: Treating [bone fractures](/docs/wiki/injuries/fractures.md#bone-fracture) with more expensive and invasive surgical techniques to speed up the healing process significantly.

$\rightarrow$ *see [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke)*

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Cure stroke: stereotactic surgery** &mdash; Perform stereotactic surgery to cure a hemorrhagic stroke.  
> Stereotactic surgery is a minimally invasive form of surgical intervention that makes use of a three-dimensional coordinate system to locate small targets inside the body, allowing for precise localization of the ruptured blood vessel while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.  
> A very complex and delicate procedure that requires a high level of skill and precision but yields a very high success rate."_

**Used for**: Treating [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke) with excellent medical knowledge and advanced medical equipment at a high success rate.

**Skill Requirements**: `Medicine` at level 8  
**Research Requirements**: [Neurosurgery](/docs/wiki/research.md#neurosurgery)

**Work Amount**: 4500

## Thoracotomy

$\rightarrow$ *see [lung collapse](/docs/wiki/injuries/lung-collapse.md#lung-collapse)*

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Repair collapsed lung: thoracotomy** &mdash; Perform a thoracotomy to repair a collapsed lung.  
> Thoracotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the chest wall to gain access to the lungs and the surrounding structures. The source of the air leak causing the lung collapse is identified and repaired, and pleural space is drained to allow the lung to re-expand and to relieve the pressure on the heart and other organs. Finally, the chest wall is closed and the incision is sutured.  
> A complex and invasive surgery that requires a skilled surgeon and yields a moderate success rate."_

**Used for**: Treating [lung collapse](/docs/wiki/injuries/lung-collapse.md#lung-collapse) with invasive surgical techniques to repair the damage and restore the lung to full function. Moderate success rate and moderate risk of complications.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Cure stroke: trepanation** &mdash; Perform a trepanation to cure a hemorrhagic stroke.  
> Trepanation is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases or release pressured blood buildup from an injury. It is one of the oldest surgical procedures known to humanity, with evidence of its practice dating back to the Neolithic era. While it is a simple and straightforward procedure, it carries a high risk of infection and complications.  
> A basic surgery that can be performed by anyone with rudimentary medical knowledge. Yields a low success rate."_

**Used for**: Treating [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke) with readily available equipment and basic medical knowledge at a mediocre success rate.

**Skill Requirements**: `Medicine` at level 2  
**Research Requirements**: [Basic anatomy](/docs/wiki/research.md#basic-anatomy)  
**Ingredients**: 2x `Herbal Medicine` or better  
**Surgery Success Chance Factor[^2]**: 90%  
**Death on Failed Surgery Chance[^3]**: 7.5%  
**Work Amount**: 1500  

> [!CAUTION]
> While cheap and easy to perform, trepanation carries a very high risk of failure and death due to the rudimentary tools involved. Unless absolutely necessary, it is strongly recommended to use more advanced surgical techniques, such as [decompressive craniectomy](/docs/wiki/surgeries.md#decompressive-craniectomy) or [stereotactic surgery](/docs/wiki/surgeries.md#stereotactic-surgery), to treat [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke) in a more controlled and effective manner.

## Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery

$\rightarrow$ *see [lung collapse](/docs/wiki/injuries/lung-collapse.md#lung-collapse)*

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Repair collapsed lung: video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery** &mdash; Perform a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to repair a collapsed lung.  
> Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that involves making small incisions in the chest wall and using a camera and specialized instruments to repair the collapsed lung. Since the surgery is performed through small incisions, it is associated with less pain, shorter recovery time, and reduced risk of complications compared to traditional open surgery.  
> While VATS is less invasive and offers a higher success rate than thoracotomy, it requires highly specialized equipment, additional training, and takes longer to perform, given the complexity of the procedure."_

**Used for**: Treating [lung collapse](/docs/wiki/injuries/lung-collapse.md#lung-collapse) with minimally invasive surgical techniques to repair the damage and restore the lung to full function. High success rate and low risk of complications.

**Skill Requirements**: `Medicine` at level 8  
**Research Requirements**: [Advanced thoracic surgery](/docs/wiki/research.md#advanced-thoracic-surgery)  
**Ingredients**: 3x `Medicine` or better, 1x[^1] [Thoracoscope](/docs/wiki/medical-devices.md#thoracoscope)  
**Surgery Success Chance Factor[^2]**: 135%  
**Death on Failed Surgery Chance[^3]**: 1%  
**Work Amount**: 4000
