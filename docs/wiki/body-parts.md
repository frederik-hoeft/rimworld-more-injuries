More Injuries simulates a variety of new body parts and re-scales the coverage of existing body parts to provide a more detailed and realistic simulation of injuries and medical conditions.

## Small and Large Intestines

The small and large intestines are part of the digestive system and play a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients and the elimination of waste. Damage to the intestines can cause life-threatening internal bleeding or cases of [chemical peritonitis](#chemical-peritonitis), which poses a major risk of infection.

## Femoral and Popliteal Arteries

The femoral and popliteal arteries are major blood vessels that supply blood to the legs and feet. As such, injuries to the legs can cause severe blood loss and can quickly lead to [hypovolemic shock](#hypovolemic-shock), loss of consciousness, and death if not treated immediately. Cutting the femoral artery is especially dangerous due to the high volume of blood that flows through it. 

Emergency treatment often requires the use of a [tourniquet](#tourniquet) to restrict blood flow to the affected limb and prevent the patient from bleeding out.

## Spinal Cord

The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the center of the back and connects the brain to the rest of the body. Damage to the spinal cord can cause irreversible and life-changing [paralysis](#paralysis), ranging from sensory loss in the legs to complete loss of movement in the entire body. Surgical intervention and bionic implants may be used to restore partial or full function to the affected body parts.
