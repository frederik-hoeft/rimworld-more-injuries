Hydrostatic shock, also known as Hydro-shock, is the controversial concept that a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a pressure wave that causes _"remote neural damage"_, _"subtle damage in neural tissues"_ and _"rapid effects"_ in living targets.

Due to the controversial nature of the concept, it is implemented as an optional feature that can be enabled in the mod settings.

If enabled, high-energy projectiles, such as bullets, may cause [hemorrhagic stroke](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemorrhagic-stroke.md#hemorrhagic-stroke), even if the projectile does not directly hit the head.
