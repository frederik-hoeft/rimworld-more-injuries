In this context, "brain damage" refers to a range of temporary or permanent neurological conditions that can occur as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, or [hypoxia](/docs/wiki/injuries/hypoxia.md#hypoxia). Brain damage can manifest in various ways, including cognitive impairments, motor dysfunction, and changes in personality. The severity and type of brain damage depend on the extent of the injury and the specific areas of the brain affected.

Brain damage may not always be immediately apparent, as some symptoms may take time to develop as the patient recovers from the initial injury. In some cases, brain damage may be reversible with experimental treatments, such as [mechanite therapy](/docs/wiki/injuries/mechanite-therapy.md#mechanite-therapy) or [cellular regenerative neurosurgery](/docs/wiki/surgeries.md#cellular-regenerative-neurosurgery), which can help repair damaged brain tissue and restore normal function. However, these futuristic treatments require advanced research and technology, and may be expensive and time-consuming to perform.

**Causes**: [hypoxia](/docs/wiki/injuries/hypoxia.md#hypoxia-brain)

**Effects**: Effects of brain damage can vary widely depending on the specific areas of the brain affected and the severity of the injury. Common effects are listed below.

## Agnosia

Agnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by an inability to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is neither defective nor is there any significant memory loss.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Agnosia** &mdash; Damage to the occipital or temporal lobes has impaired the ability to recognize objects or faces, despite normal vision. Affected patients may have trouble identifying items or people, leading to confusion and slower task performance."_

**Effects**: Reduced work speed, research speed, and social impact, depending on the severity of the condition. Negative mood effects may occur due to frustration or confusion caused by the inability to recognize familiar objects or people.

**Thoughts per Stage**:
> _"**Things look unfamiliar** (-2) &mdash; Sometimes I catch myself hesitating, unsure of what I'm looking at. It's subtle, but unsettling - like the world is just slightly off."_  
> _"**Misrecognizing people and objects** (-4) &mdash; I keep mistaking objects - or even people - for others. It's confusing, and I often feel embarrassed or disoriented."_  
> _"**Faces blur together** (-6) &mdash; Everyone looks the same. I have to rely on voices or context to tell people apart. It's isolating and makes social interaction exhausting."_  
> _"**Nothing makes visual sense** (-8) &mdash; The world around me is a jumble of shapes and colors. I can't rely on sight to recognize what I see anymore. Every task is harder, and I feel disconnected from everything."_

## Aphasia

Aphasia, also known as dysphasia, is an impairment in a person's ability to comprehend or formulate language because of dysfunction in specific brain regions.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Aphasia** &mdash; Permanent damage to nerve cells in the language centers of the brain has resulted in pronounced difficulty with communication. This can manifest as word-finding difficulties, fragmented speech, or even complete muteness. The severity of the aphasia can vary based on the extent of the damage."_

**Effects**: Reduced talking capacity, trade price penalty when trading. Negative mood effects may occur due to frustration or confusion caused by the inability to communicate effectively.

**Thoughts per Stage**:

> _"**Word-finding difficulty** (-2) &mdash; Struggling to find the right words can be frustrating and isolating. I feel embarrassed when I can't express myself clearly."_  
> _"**Fragmented speech** (-4) &mdash; I can speak, but my sentences are often incomplete or jumbled. It's like my thoughts are scattered, and I can't put them together."_  
> _"**Non-fluent** (-6) &mdash; Every conversation feels like a struggle. I can't form complex sentences, and it's hard to communicate even basic ideas. I want to express myself, but my words fail me."_  
> _"**Barely verbal** (-8) &mdash; My ability to speak has been reduced to almost nothing. I can only manage a few words at a time, and even those are difficult to pronounce. I feel trapped in my own silence."_  
> _"**Completely nonverbal** (-10) &mdash; I can no longer speak at all. My thoughts are locked inside me, and I can't communicate with others. I feel alone and isolated, unable to share my feelings or ideas."_

## Executive Dysfunction

In psychology and neuroscience, executive dysfunction, or executive function deficit, is a disruption to the efficacy of the executive functions, which is a group of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive dysfunction can refer to both neurocognitive deficits and behavioural symptoms.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Executive dysfunction** &mdash; Damage to the frontal lobes has impaired executive functions, including decision-making, planning, and impulse control. Affected individuals may act erratically or inappropriately, and struggle with organization, prioritization, and regulating emotions, leading to difficulties in daily life and social interactions."_

**Effects**: Periodic mental breaks, increased risk of social fights.

## Hippocampal Damage

Hippocampal damage refers to damage to the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is critical for memory formation and spatial navigation. Damage to this area can result in significant memory impairments, including difficulty forming new memories and recalling past events.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Hippocampal damage** &mdash; Damage to the hippocampus has impaired memory formation and spatial navigation. Affected individuals may become confused about their surroundings, forget where they are, and have difficulty navigating or recalling past events."_

**Effects**: Periodic mental breaks of type "confused wandering," memory loss, reduced learning factor, reduced work speed, periodic mental breaks at higher stages. Negative mood effects may occur due to frustration or confusion caused by memory impairments.

**Thoughts per Stage**:
> _"**Disoriented** (-2) &mdash; Sometimes I forget why I walked into a room or what I was just doing. It's like my thoughts vanish mid-sentence."_  
> _"**Forgetting simple things** (-4) &mdash; I've started forgetting names, places, tasks. It's frustrating, like sand slipping through my fingers whenever I try to recall something."_  
> _"**Losing track of time** (-6) &mdash; Hours blur together. Sometimes I wake up not knowing where I am or what day it is. I feel lost - even in familiar places."_  
> _"**Memories feel distant** (-8) &mdash; Memories feel like someone else's dreams. Faces, places, and events all seem unfamiliar. I'm scared of forgetting everything."_  
> _"**Losing sense of self** (-10) &mdash; My identity feels fragile. I struggle to remember who I am, what I've done, or what I care about. It's like I'm fading away, and I don't know how to stop it."_

## Motor Dysfunction

Motor dysfunction refers to a range of movement disorders that can occur as a result of brain damage. These disorders can affect coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, leading to difficulties with tasks such as walking, writing, or using tools.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Motor dysfunction** &mdash; Neurological damage to the motor cortex has resulted in permanent impairment of the motor system. This can manifest as weakness, tremors, or difficulty coordinating movements. The severity of the dysfunction can vary based on the extent of the damage."_

**Effects**: Reduced moving speed, reduced manipulation capacity. Negative mood effects may occur due to frustration or confusion caused by motor impairments.

**Thoughts per Stage**:
> _"**Clumsy** (-2) &mdash; My movements feel less precise than they used to be. I drop things more often and stumble occasionally. It's frustrating, but manageable."_  
> _"**Shaky and unsteady** (-4) &mdash; My hands tremble, and walking in a straight line takes concentration. Tasks that used to be simple now require real effort and care."_  
> _"**Struggling to control my body** (-6) &mdash; Basic actions are difficult. My limbs don't always respond the way I want them to, and I often lose coordination. It makes me feel helpless and vulnerable."_  
> _"**Near-paralyzed** (-8) &mdash; Moving feels like dragging weights through water. I can barely walk, and using my hands has become incredibly difficult. I rely on others for more than I'd like to admit."_  
> _"**Trapped in a failing body** (-10) &mdash; My body no longer obeys me. Every step, every grasp is a monumental challenge. I feel like a living vegetable, unable to do anything for myself, and completely dependent on others. It's a nightmare."_

## Personality Shift

> **In-Game Description**
> _"Due to severe brain damage, {0} has undergone a significant shift in personality. They may have become more skilled in certain areas, but also may have lost some of their previous skills. This change is permanent and may require some reorientation for their role in the colony."_

**Effects**: Permanent change in personality, which includes a redistribution of skills corresponding to the extend of the brain damage. For example, a pawn may become more skilled in combat or social interactions, but lose some of their previous skills in crafting or research. This change is permanent and may require some reorientation for their role in the colony.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature can be disabled in the mod settings if you prefer not to have personality shifts as a result of brain damage.
