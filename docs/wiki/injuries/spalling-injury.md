When high-velocity projectiles are stopped by armor, the large amount of kinetic energy can cause the projectile and top layer of the armor to shatter into fragments, which can cause additional injuries to the wearer of the armor, even if the projectile itself did not penetrate. The chance and severity of spalling depends on a variety of factors, such as the angle of impact and the hardness and condition of the armor. 

Modern armor is designed to prevent spalling by adding softer layers above the hard armor plates to catch and absorb bullet fragments. As armor condition deteriorates after absorbing damage, the chance of spalling naturally increases when these absorbing layers are compromised.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Cut (spall)** &mdash; A cut caused by spall of a bullet and armor fragments."_

**Causes**: High-velocity projectiles impacting degraded armor plating.

**Effects**: Additional cuts and lacerations caused by bullet fragments and armor shrapnel.

**Treatment**: Spalling injuries can be treated like any other cut or laceration, by treating the wound with or without medicine, preferably in a clean environment to reduce the risk of infection.

> [!TIP]
> You can significantly reduce the risk of spalling injuries or even prevent them entirely by keeping your armor in good condition and replacing it when it becomes damaged. Alternatively, you can research into advanced spacer armor types that are designed to prevent spalling entirely.

> [!TIP]
> You can tweak the chance, severity, and armor condition thresholds for spalling injuries in the mod settings to better balance the risk and reward of using degraded armor plating in combat.
