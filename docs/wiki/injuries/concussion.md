> **In-Game Description**  
> _"**Concussion** &mdash; A concussion, also known as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a head injury that temporarily affects brain functioning. Symptoms may include loss of consciousness; memory loss; headaches; difficulty with thinking, concentration, or balance; nausea; blurred vision; dizziness; sleep disturbances, and mood changes.  
> Should resolve on its own within a few days, but can be worsened by repeated head injuries."_

**Causes**: Blunt force trauma to the head. May be caused by any violent impact to the head, such as hand-to-hand combat, being struck by a projectile, or explosions.

**Effects**: A concussion may range from a mild headache to full unconsciousness, depending on the severity of the injury. The pawn may experience a temporary loss of consciousness, memory loss, painful headaches, disorientation,difficulty with thinking, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, and dizziness.
