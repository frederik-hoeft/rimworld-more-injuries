> **In-Game Description**
> _"**&lt;injury type&gt; (enclosed)**"_

Bleed rates of injuries are now dynamically calculated and depend on the depth of the injury. For example, a gunshot wound to the abdomen may be bandaged on the exterior, but the internal organs may still be bleeding until properly treated. Such enclosed injuries bleed at a slower rate than open injuries, but they can still be life-threatening if not treated properly. 

**Causes**: Penetrating injuries with damage to internal organs, where only the exterior (skin layer) is bandaged.

**Effects**: Internal bleeding continues at a reduced rate compared to open injuries, but can still be life-threatening if not treated properly.

**Treatment**: Enclosed injuries may be treated with vanilla RimWorld treatment methods, such as medicine or treatment without medicine.
