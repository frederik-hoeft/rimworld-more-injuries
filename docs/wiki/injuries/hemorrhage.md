> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Hemorrhage** &mdash; Spontaneous hemorrhaging is a condition where bleeding occurs without any apparent external cause, often due to underlying medical issues such as coagulopathy or vascular abnormalities. It can manifest as bruising, nosebleeds, or internal bleeding and may require medical intervention to manage the underlying causes and prevent complications. In severe cases, it can lead to significant blood loss, multiple organ failure, and death if not treated promptly.  
> While treating the underlying cause is essential, immediate management may include stabilizing the patient, controlling bleeding, and administering blood products for fluid resuscitation."_

**Causes**: [Coagulopathy](/docs/wiki/injuries/coagulopathy.md#coagulopathy)

**Effects**: Spontaneous bleeding injuries that require immediate medical intervention to prevent further blood loss and complications.

**Treatment**: Stabilizing the patient, controlling bleeding, bandaging the affected area, and reversing the underlying cause of the coagulopathy, such as [acidosis](/docs/wiki/injuries/acidosis.md#acidosis), [hypothermia](/docs/wiki/injuries/hypothermia.md#hypothermia), or [hemodilution](/docs/wiki/injuries/hemodilution.md#hemodilution). In severe cases, it may be necessary to administer [blood products](/docs/wiki/medical-devices.md#blood-bag) for fluid resuscitation and to restore blood volume.
