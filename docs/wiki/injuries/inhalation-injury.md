Inhalation injuries are caused by the inhalation of hot gases, steam, or smoke, which can cause burns to the respiratory tract and lungs. If enabled in the mod settings, inhalation injuries manifest themselves as burn injuries to the lungs, for example, when a pawn is exposed to a fire or explosion.

Preventative measures include avoiding exposure to hot gases, steam, or smoke, and wearing protective gear such as gas masks or respirators in hazardous environments. Pawns with natural fire resistance or high toxic environment tolerance may be less susceptible to inhalation injuries.
