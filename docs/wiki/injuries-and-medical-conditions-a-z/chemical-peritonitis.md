Also known as _"intestinal spillage,"_ chemical peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when gastric acid or other digestive fluids leak into the abdominal cavity, causing inflammation and tissue damage to surrounding organs ([small and large intestines](#small-and-large-intestines), stomach, kidneys, and liver). The condition carries a major risk of infection which can be life-threatening if left untreated.

> **In-Game Description**
> _"**Chemical peritonitis** &mdash; As a result of a perforating injury to intestines or stomach, gastric acid has inflicted tissue damage on surrounding organs, causing inflammation. Carries a major risk of infection."_

**Causes**: A perforating injury to the intestines or stomach, such as a gunshot wound or stab wound, that allows gastric acid to leak into the abdominal cavity and cause tissue damage.

**Effects**: Inflammation of the abdominal cavity, severe pain, and a major risk of infection. Potentially life-threatening if a resulting infection is left untreated.

**Treatment**: Medical treatment of the perforating injury and inflammation using high-quality medicine to prevent infection.
