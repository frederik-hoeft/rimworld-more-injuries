## About More Injuries

The More Injuries mod aims to increase the simulation depth of RimWorld's medical system by adding a variety of new injuries, medical conditions, and treatment options, as well as simulating body part damage in more detail and introducing pathophysiological interactions between injuries and medical conditions; meaning that injuries and medical conditions can affect each other in complex ways, leading to cascading effects that can be difficult to manage. The mod also adds new body parts, medical devices, procedures, surgeries, research projects, and work types to enhance the medical gameplay experience.
Its goal is to make the medical system more challenging and interesting in some aspects, while also making it more realistic and immersive. A detailed mod settings menu is provided to allow players to customize many aspects of the mod to their liking.

## Known Issues and Incompatibilities

This section lists known issues and incompatibilities with other mods that have been identified during testing and development of More Injuries. If you encounter any issues or incompatibilities with other mods, please report them on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/frederik-hoeft/rimworld-more-injuries/issues) with a minimal, reproducible example. - meaning the minimum set of mods in a new save game that still reproduces the issue. To allow for a quick resolution of the issue, please provide as much information as possible, including the exact steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior observed.

*Currently, no incompatibilities have been verifiably pinpointed to any specific mods, although there have been reports of issues with massive mod lists that may or may not be related to More Injuries.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When reporting an issue, please make sure to include the following information:
> - The minimal set of mods required to reproduce the issue. This list can be obtained by starting a new game with only the required mods enabled and adding the mods back one by one until the issue reappears. This process may be sped up by using any helpful information from the game logs.
> - The exact steps necessary to reproduce the issue *in a new save game*. This information is crucial to help the developers understand the issue and find a solution.
> - The expected behavior and the actual behavior observed. This information helps the developers to understand the issue and verify that the issue has been resolved.
> - Any stack traces, error messages, or other relevant information from the game logs that may help to identify the cause of the issue. If possible, please load the [Visual Exceptions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2538411704) mod which will help indentify integration issues with other mods.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before reporting exceptions or errors from the debug console, please make sure that at least one line of the stack trace mentions `MoreInjuries` or that you are able to prove that the issue is caused by More Injuries. Otherwise, the issue may not be related to More Injuries and is unlikely to be resolved by the developers for lack of avenues to investigate the issue.
