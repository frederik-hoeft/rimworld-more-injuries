# Known Issues and Incompatibilities

This section lists known issues and incompatibilities with other mods that have been identified during testing and development of More Injuries. If you encounter any issues or incompatibilities with other mods, please report them on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/frederik-hoeft/rimworld-more-injuries/issues) with a minimal, reproducible example. - meaning the minimum set of mods in a new save game that still reproduces the issue. To allow for a quick resolution of the issue, please provide as much information as possible, including the exact steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior observed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When reporting an issue, please make sure to include the following information:
> - The minimal set of mods required to reproduce the issue. This list can be obtained by starting a new game with only the required mods enabled and adding the mods back one by one until the issue reappears. This process may be sped up by using any helpful information from the game logs.
> - The exact steps necessary to reproduce the issue *in a new save game*. This information is crucial to help the developers understand the issue and find a solution.
> - The expected behavior and the actual behavior observed. This information helps the developers to understand the issue and verify that the issue has been resolved.
> - Any stack traces, error messages, or other relevant information from the game logs that may help to identify the cause of the issue. If possible, please load the [Visual Exceptions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2538411704) mod which will help indentify integration issues with other mods.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before reporting exceptions or errors from the debug console, please make sure that at least one line of the stack trace mentions `MoreInjuries` or that you are able to prove that the issue is caused by More Injuries. Otherwise, the issue may not be related to More Injuries and is unlikely to be resolved by the developers for lack of avenues to investigate the issue.
