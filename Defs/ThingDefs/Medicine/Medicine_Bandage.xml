    <description>Pieces of fabric prepared to slow the flow of blood from wounds. This type of elastic bandage is designed as a temporary measure to apply pressure to a wound to reduce the bleed rate and promote clotting. It is not a substitute for proper medical treatment, but can be used to stabilize a patient until they can be treated by a doctor. Moderately fast to apply, but may not be as effective as a hemostatic agent in stopping severe bleeding.</description>
