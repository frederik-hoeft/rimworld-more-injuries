    <label>hemostatic agent</label>
    <description>A special chemical compound designed to promote blood clotting and reduce the flow of blood from wounds. Hemostatic agents are used to control bleeding in emergency situations, such as when a patient is suffering from severe trauma or has been injured in combat. The compound is fast-acting and can be used to stabilize a patient until they can be treated by a doctor. However, it is not a substitute for proper medical treatment.\n\nQuick to apply and effective at stopping severe bleeding, hemostatic agents are an essential part of any first aid kit.</description>
