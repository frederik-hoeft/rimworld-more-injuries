Since ancient times, it has been widely used for emergency surgery in field conditions in war zones, for example, during the Vietnam War. A 2011 clinical practice guideline supports the use of ketamine as a sedative in emergency medicine, including during physically painful procedures.\n\nBy reverse-engineering the ancient pharmaceutical formulations from the early 2000s and developing precision dosing protocols, your colony will gain the knowledge required to synthesize ketamine safely. This unlocks the ability to craft ketamine for surgical use and to sedate uncooperative patients in the field, allowing your doctors to perform life-saving procedures on even the most unhinged "volunteers" to join your colony.\n\nWhile usually not addictive when used in therapeutic doses, abuse of ketamine can lead to dangerous buildup of the drug in the body, resulting in toxicity and overdose. Therefore, it is important to monitor patients closely for signs of ketamine buildup and to avoid excessive dosing. -->
