  <!-- EN: A morphine autoinjector is a medical device used to deliver a controlled dose of morphine, an opioid pain medication, directly into the bloodstream. Once injected, morphine rapidly suppresses pain but risks respiratory depression and impaired resuscitation if used during severe blood loss or cardiac arrest. Best reserved for controlled environments or after bleeding is stabilized. Should not be mixed with other CNS depressants like alcohol or ketamine. -->

  <!-- EN: A piece of cloth soaked in chloroform, used to render a patient unconscious for medical procedures. It is effective in emergency situations where rapid sedation is required. However, due to a variety of factors, such as duration of exposure, concentration of chloroform, and individual patient factors, administering an appropriate dose can be difficult and risk of overdose is high. Due to its high potential for side effects, such as respiratory depression, hepatic and renal damage, and cardiac arrest, modern medicine has largely replaced chloroform with safer alternatives. -->
