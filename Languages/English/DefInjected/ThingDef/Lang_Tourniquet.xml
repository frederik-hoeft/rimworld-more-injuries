  <!-- EN: A tourniquet is a constricting or compressing device used to control venous and arterial circulation to an extremity for a period of time. It is used to stop hemorrhaging (bleeding) and is most commonly used in emergency situations, such as battlefield injuries or accidents, to prevent hypovolemic shock and death.\n\nAs a tourniquet restricts blood flow to the limb, it should be removed as soon as possible to prevent ischemia (starvation of oxygen) and necrosis (cell death) in the limb, which can lead to gangrene or death from sepsis. -->
