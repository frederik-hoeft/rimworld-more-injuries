  <!-- EN: A 250ml bag of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, commonly known as normal saline. This sterile, isotonic fluid is used for intravenous resuscitation to quickly restore circulating volume during hypovolemic shock. While it helps stabilize blood pressure and prevent dehydration, it contains no red blood cells and cannot replace lost oxygen-carrying capacity or clotting factors.\n\nExcessive use may cause hemodilution or coagulopathy, so it should only be used in small amounts or in conjunction with whole blood or other blood products. -->
