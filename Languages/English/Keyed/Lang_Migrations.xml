It seems that the colonists have forgotten how to perform basic medical procedures, and they agree that they should prioritize researching the lost medical knowledge.\n\nMoreInjuries has been updated to v1.5.2 "Shiny Research". Among shiny new textures, localization support, bug fixes, and new features, this update also introduces a new research tree, which can be found in the "More Injuries" tab of the research screen.

  <!-- EN: MoreInjuries has been updated to v1.5.2.1. This update includes bug fixes, balance adjustments, and quality-of-life improvements.\n\nDoctors will no longer get stuck trying to splint fractures when no splints are available. Research requirements have been eased slightly, and CPR is now a standalone research project. If you previously unlocked CPR as part of the Emergency Medicine project, the new CPR research will be unlocked automatically for you.\n\nIn the tourniquet UI, heavily bleeding limbs are now highlighted in yellow and red. Doctors will also auto-apply tourniquets (from inventory) as part of the Provide First Aid job. The bleeding severity threshold for this can be adjusted in mod settings in the Tourniquets and Gangrene section.\n\nFor the full changelog, see the Steam Workshop or GitHub page. -->
