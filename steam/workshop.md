More Injuries adds a wide variety of new injuries, treatments, and complications that interact in complex ways, creating realistic medical challenges and high-stakes emergencies. It also expands the simulation with finer-grained body parts, new surgeries, medical equipment, and research - all fully customizable through mod settings.

This is a fully reworked and expanded version of the [original pre-1.5 More Injuries mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2892012512), featuring numerous fixes and additions.
