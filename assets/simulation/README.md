# Design Documents

This directory contains some of the design documents and notes used for simulating some of the injuries and mechanics in the game. Most of these documents serve as a reference for the implementation details and underlying logic of the injury system. Some of them were generated automatically using ChatGPT's "deep research" capabilities.

ChatGPT was instructed to cite peer-reviewed journals and established medical literature to ensure accuracy and reliability in the information presented. Nevertheless, since the summaries presented in these documents are based on AI-generated content, ensure to check the original papers for information on the specific studies and findings referenced.
